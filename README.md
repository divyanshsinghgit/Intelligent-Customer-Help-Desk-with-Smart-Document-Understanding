Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding is my internship project of 2020 in SmartInternz Internship Program at SmartBrigde. Here I got the access to IBM lite account and I used several IBM lite services such as Watson Assistant, Discovery, Cloud Function and Node Red App.

Working of Project : The typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer that the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person but here we will be having another option as Watson Discovery Service which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owners manual. So now, instead of “Would you like to speak to a customer representative?” we can return relevant sections of the owners manual to help solve our customers’ problems. This will improve the answers returned from the queries.

In Watson Discovery I have added ecobee3_UserGuidepurposeful as the owner's manual.
